				<p align="justify">Character creation is meant to develop functioning character within the scope of the setting. Below outlines the basic process to creating a character in simple terms and instructions. It should also be noted, unless otherwise mentioned by the Game Master (GM), that stories focus on themes of exploration and unknowns of the universe at large. Will you play a Jotun Mercenary, an Alfar Scholar, or become the specialized Arcane Engineer?<br>
				<br>
				It should be noted and understood that players are in a group environment. Players should not feel hampered in the character creation process, but your characters will be involved with a party for a marginal amount of time, hopefully. Respect one another above table, and have fun its just a game. If one character has issue with another, that should not leave the in character aspect and boil into out of character conversation.<br>
				<br>
				<a href="">Character Sheets</a> or regular paper are suggested for use in recording your character.

			<h2><center>5. Pick Two Starting Class Abilities</center></h2>
			<p align="justify">Now the Players delve into what their characters are particularly good at doing. These are particular abilities that each class typically teaches, but its on the player to pick for their character. Things like throwing weapons, modifying magitechnology, or even blocking for an ally are represented in the class abilities. At character creation each player will pick two of the starting abilities to further flesh out their character. Each level after they will pick an additional ability and at level five they will have the option to begin taking advanced abilities.<br><br>

				<h2>Further Developing the Character</h2>
				<p align="justify">It's also important to develop the backstory of a character past the plain statistics. After all people are more than just numbers and figures. Below are some suggested questions to consider while making a character to develop their personality and history:</p>
				<p align="justify">1. Is this character Adventurous? Why or Why not?<br>
													 2. Who are this character's parants? Whereare they now?<br>
												   3. What are this character's immediate goals?<br>
												   4. Why are they with the party?<br>
												   5. What is this character's greatest achievment<br>
												   6. Does this character show mercy?</p>
