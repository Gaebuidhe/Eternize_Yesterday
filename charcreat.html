				<p align="justify">Character creation is meant to develop functioning character within the scope of the setting. Below outlines the basic process to creating a character in simple terms and instructions. It should also be noted, unless otherwise mentioned by the Game Master (GM), that stories focus on themes of exploration and unknowns of the universe at large. Will you play a Jotun Mercenary, an Alfar Scholar, or become the specialized Arcane Engineer?<br>
				<br>
				It should be noted and understood that players are in a group environment. Players should not feel hampered in the character creation process, but your characters will be involved with a party for a marginal amount of time, hopefully. Respect one another above table, and have fun its just a game. If one character has issue with another, that should not leave the in character aspect and boil into out of character conversation.<br>
