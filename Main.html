				<p align="justify">In those days, it was said the old days humans were but an after thought in the minds of the <i>gods</i>. They forged the gates around Midgard to explore the nine realms. Exploring and seeding new hospitable planets. Their original names were lost to time, but their descendents would come to be called the Vanir. In time the realms would expand past the original Nine, always in search of new hospitable worlds to populate<br><br>
				But all things come to an end, and the Vanir civilization fell into decline, colonies were made forfeit, and gates lost power. Soon the colonies diverged from the blood of the Vanir, and created the races we see today. Eventually the Aesir would create the device they called the Bifr&ouml;st, and they would rediscover and repower the lost Midgard gates.<br><br>
				<center><i>So here we are; a universe to rediscover, dangers through every gate, and legends lost to time!</i></center></p>
