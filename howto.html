				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p align="justify"><i>D12 Only System</i>, created by Patrick Flynn from Three Gold Games, is built around the twelve sided die (D12) and only the D12. As with all systems that utilize dice, the D12 represents a modicum of success or failure when attempting an action, bringing in the game aspect to Roleplay Games (RPG). Characters having certain statistics to modify their ability perform that action for better or for worse. This page will explain the basics of how to play, and what certain terms may mean. however for more definitions head to the glossary to find out more.
				<br><br>
			  There will be references throughout that refer to 1D12, this simply means one twelve sided die roll.</p>

			<h2><center>Stats</center></h2>
			<p align="justify">Statistics (stats) are a way to quantify and balance what a character can and will do. This covers things like a characters skills, attributes, and even their weapons and armor have stats that help maintain the precarious balance of the RPG. As a character levels or plays, events or developments will adjust their stats bringing even more depth to the character.<br><br>
			From the main stats (aka attributes), one determines all their derived sats such as skills, hit points (HP), and mana points (MP). HP is a measure of ones ability to take damage over time until they either fall unconcious or even die, it is calculated by adding Endurance + 13.<br><br>
			MP is a character's capacity to cast magic over time, it is calculated by adding Intellect + 8. These figures may be different from the various <i>D12 Only System</i> setting guides. More on <a href="./howto/magic.html">magic</a> can be found here.<br><br>
			The final stat to be aware of is the character's level. This represents a characters experience in the setting, their progression in their field of study, etc. As characters level they'll gain more abilities, skills, and hardiness.

			<h2><center>Checks</center></h2>
			<p align="justify">For this system there are typically three types of checks: <a href="./howto/skills.html">Proficiency</a>, <a href="./howto/combat.html">Initiative</a>, and <a href="./howto/combat.html">Combat</a>. Each having its own purpose in <i>D12 Only System</i>.<br><br>
			<u>Proficiency Checks</u> are a type of difficulty check that adds a 1D12 plus times the proficiency rank plus the linked attribute. (1D12 + 2(PR) + attribute). The number generated is then compared to the difficulty of the task determined by the Game Master (GM). If the number equals to or exceeds the difficulty, then the check succeeds.<br><br>
			<u>Initiative Checks</u> is used to determin who goes first in the combat order. Characters and enemies will roll 1D12 plus agility, then the numbers will be ordered highest to lowest for the turn order.<br><br>
			<u>Combat Checks</u> are your basic attack checks. A roll is determined by 1D12 plus proficiency ranks plus the attached attribute.</p>
